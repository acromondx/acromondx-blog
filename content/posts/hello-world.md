### Pseudo-Intro
Hi, my name is Gideon and I am the owner of this blog. I have always wanted a blog but Mr. Procrastination didn't let me build one. 

Here am I with my first blog post. Well, I guess I defeated Mr. Procrastination ðŸ˜„.

Currently, I have not idea of the kind of content I will publish here. Maybe I will write personal stuff or coding(flutter & python) or both.

### About this blog
I have always been a big fan of static site generators. That is why when the time arrived for me to create a blog, I couldn't resist it. The decision for the right static site generator Sophy's choice all over again. There are a lot of static site genrators out there. Jekyll and Hugo was on top of my list.

Below, I will explain my experience with jekll and hugo and why I settled for the latter.

#### Jekyll
Jekyll is a great static site generator. It's a product of github, hence, integration with github pages is seamless.
