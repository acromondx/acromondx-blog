### Pseudo-Intro
Hi, my name is Gideon and I am the owner of this blog. I have always wanted a blog but Mr. Procrastination didn't let me build one. 

Here I am with my first blog post. Well, I guess I defeated Mr. Procrastination ðŸ˜„.

Currently, I have not idea of the kind of content I will publish here. Maybe I will write personal stuff or coding(flutter & python) or both.

### About the blog
I am a big fan of static site generators (**SSGs**). That's why when the time came for me to create my blog, I only considered static site solutions (I'm sorry WordPress ðŸ¤£).

#### Hugo
Choosing the right SSGs was like Sophie's choice all over again. I spent 2 weeks trying out most of the popular SSGs out there. To make my life simplier, I narrowed down my needs into three specifications:

 - Page build speed
 - Markdown support
 - 
Based on the above criteria, Hugo stood out to be the obvious answer to my dilemma even though jekyll was really close.
