### Pseudo-Intro
My name is Gideon Acromond, and I own this blog. Mr. Procrastination has prevented me from creating a blog, despite my constant desire to do so.

My first blog post is right here. I suppose I've now beaten Mr. Procrastination.

Right now I have no clue what type of stuff I will publish on this site. I might write about things I find fascinating.

### About the blog
I am a big fan of static site generators (**SSGs**). That's why when the time came for me to create my blog, I only considered static site solutions (I'm sorry WordPress ðŸ¤£).

#### Hugo
Choosing the right SSGs was like Sophie's choice all over again. I spent 2 weeks trying out most of the popular SSGs out there. To make my life simplier, I narrowed down my needs into three specifications:

 - Page build speed
 - Simplicity and flexibility 
 - Markdown support

Based on the above criteria, Hugo stood out to be the obvious answer to my dilemma even though jekyll was really close.

 #### Hosting
 The raw files of the blog can be found on my github repo. The generated static site is hosted on netlify


 #### Comments
I am using disqus for comments. I enjoy the emoji reactions at the end of every post
